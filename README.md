# [Crypto Party](https://www.cryptoparty.in)
Privacy is the room in which ideas develop, where you can reflect on those
ideas whenever you choose. This room is not only physical, but digital as well.
Neither governments nor corporations respect that. But we do.

## Security Warning
Security is a process, not a tool. You need at least basic understanding to
assess the degree of security or anonymity a tool can give you. That said,
treat it like a game. The worst thing which can happen if you use these tools
for your everyday business is that you are just as unsecure, unencrypted or in
the open as you would be anyway.
